# Currency converter

## Conventions / Glossary

- the terms "territory" and "country" are used interchangeably (e.g. Ã…land Islands are not a country,
  but they have their own entry with their own territory code)
- currency codes are always 3-characters long (**ISO4217**)
- country codes are always 2-characters long (**ISO3166**)

## API endpoints

The current API is versioned simply via path, under "/api/v1". There are two endpoints:

- the endpoint `GET /api/v1/country/<code>/currency` will return a JSON array of currency codes
  in-use in the given territory (identified by a 2-character **ISO3166** code, e.g. `US` or `GB`)
- the endpoint `GET /api/v1/currency/<code>/country` will return a JSON array of country codes
  that use the given currency (identified by a 3-character **ISO4217** code, e.g. `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`)
- the endpoint `GET /api/v1/currency/<code>/amount/<amount>` can be used to convert a value between currencies.
  By default, this endpoint will return the specified amount in the specified currency, but it also accepts
  a `?display_currency_code=...` query parameter.

  Semantically, it is the same value, so the `?display_currency_code` parameter is a query parameter,
  and not included in the URL.

  This endpoint will set the Cache-Control response header to match the time the currency information is
  expected to remain unchanged.

## Data sets

### Currency exchange rates

Exchange rates are downloaded from http://www.floatrates.com/json-feeds.html.

The exchange rates are downloaded on first-request. No initialization is needed.

### Countries and currency use

The data for the territory<->country mapping is taken from https://datahub.io/core/country-codes#data.

It is processed (to remove unneeded data) by:

    cat countries.json | jq 'map({iso4217_currencies: .["ISO4217-currency_alphabetic_code"], iso3166_country_code: .["ISO3166-1-Alpha-2"], territory_display_name: .["CLDR display name"]})'

Each entry (corresponding to a territory) in the resulting JSON file will have
these keys:

    {
      "iso4217_currencies": "ZMW",
      "iso3166_country_code": "ZM",
      "territory_display_name": "Zambia"
    }

Note: no checks for 'null' are performed/filtered (e.g. for Antarctica).
